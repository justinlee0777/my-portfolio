          <p>
            Buzzword bingo is typically reserved for stock phrases said during
            an event, but I personally use it for clich√©s and themes in general.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's best used for things that you're half-interested in, as you
            have a pretty good idea of what will happen, such as Disney and Fast
            and the Furious movies, and Hell's Kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>Though I use it for things I enjoy as well.</p>
