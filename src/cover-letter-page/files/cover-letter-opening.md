Hello, I am Justin Lee. I am a developer with six years of experience in building web applications using RESTful APIs.

This page too is a web application: this section is statically generated using Next.js, but the sections below, personalized to your company, are retrieved from a Ruby web server which itself fetches the resource from Amazon's Simple Storage Service. Please send me an e-mail if the performance is less than par.

My primary experience is in building Angular e-commerce solutions for mid-sized businesses. Below is a video walking through the most basic feature of Upscale, which is to generate a website tailored to the merchant's needs. To go through all the features would take hours.
